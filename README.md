# Work to do
You need to modify this project in order to achieve some new features

1. Modify the app to allow the user to also set the year of the product; as shown in the demo. You'll have to modify the class Product
2. The DELETE functionality works in a funny way. It does not matter in which area of the item you click: the item is always removed; even though you don't click the "Delete" button. How could you solve it? Why does it happen?
